answers to assignment 2

it is a computer that deals with maintaining, designing and developing software applications

SDLC is a set of phases that software goes through from conception to retirement while software engineering focuses on the overall processof software development

Planning : The project scope, requirements, budget and timeline are set in these phase
Analysis : stakeholders go into details about the requirements and the functionality of the project
Design : the coding of the project begins based on the requirements requsted 
Implemantation : the coding is done according to specifiction 

The Waterfall model is a linear, sequential approach best for projects with well-defined requirements, while Agile is an iterative, flexible approach ideal for projects with evolving requirements and a need for rapid delivery and customer feedback.

Software maintenance involves modifying software after its delivery to correct defects, adapt to changes in the environment, enhance functionality, and prevent future issues. Types of maintenance activities include corrective (fixing bugs), adaptive (adapting to environment changes), perfective (enhancing performance and functionality), and preventive (proactively improving code and documentation). Maintenance is crucial as it ensures software reliability, adaptation to evolving needs, improved performance, extended lifespan, customer satisfaction, and compliance with legal requirements.

Software engineers may encounter ethical issues related to privacy, security, intellectual property, fairness, transparency, and accountability. To adhere to ethical standards, they should follow guidelines like ACM or IEEE codes, stay informed through education, integrate ethics into design, seek peer review, involve users, make ethical decisions, and ensure legal compliance. These practices help engineers build trustworthy software that respects user rights and societal values.
